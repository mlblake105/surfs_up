# surfs_up

## Project Overview
In order to determine if a surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round, temperature data for the months of June and December have been isolated.

## Analysis Results

- The average temperature in June is around 4 degrees warmer in June than December
- The minimum temperature in December is 56, compared to 64 in June
- In June, only 25% of temperatures are less than 73 degrees.  In December 25% of temperature are less than 69 degrees.

## Summary
Since 75% of temperatures are just 3 degrees less than they are in June, I think it is fair to say that the surf shop would be successful.  To confirm this, however, another analysis might be completed to look at precipitation and also wind speed during these months.  Since these would play a factor in surf conditions in addition to actual temperature, it would be important to know these stats as well.
